Unix tutorial for Unit 1: Deliverables

[Unix tutorial from Griffith Lab](https://rnabio.org/module-00-setup/0000/08/01/Unix/)

When can you check the box? When you have:

~ completed all 28 exercises in the tutorial

~ saved your sessions and named them according to best practices

~ successfully transferred the files to your folder on Discovery Cluster (remember to transfer to your directory under the courses folder /courses/BIOL3411.202430/students/)

Enjoy, and post on the "Yeehaw" discussion forum on Canvas when you've done it!
