## Below is a very well explained tutorial on the basics of using git and GitHub:

[https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_getstarted.asp?remote=github](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_getstarted.asp?remote=github)

## When can you check the box on your Deliverables list? When you have:

~ completed Git Get Started through Git Send Pull Request sections of the tutorial

~ saved your sessions and named them according to best practices

~ successfully transferred the files to your folder on Discovery Cluster (remember to transfer to your directory under the courses folder /courses/BIOL3411.202430/students/`<username>`)

~ read Gitty-up.md page and completed short assignment at bottom

### Notes

Just as you did for the Unix exercises, save your terminal session(s) as you work through the assigned exercises.

Transfer the saved files (appropriately named!) to your assignments folder on Discovery (remember to use /courses/BIOL3411.202430/students/<your_folder>). 

Check the permissions setting of the file and make sure it allows second level (groups) permission to read (see session 3 slides if you need a review). If you have created a folder, such as "assignments", check permissions for that, as well.

At this point, you might want to create subfolders within Assignments, such as Unix and Git, to keep your files well organized.
